# README
A proto-type/proof-of-concept program for a machine learning education platform. Initially developed as my final year project for my Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) BSc.

## Idea
A software platform where a user with an interest, but potentially no coding or marchine learning (ML) experience, can begin to learn and experiment with ML models in a sandbox-style environment.

## Future Direction
Continue work on the project with the aim to:
- overhaul UI to something more appealing
- implement additional ML models such as SVMs, Descision Trees, Random Forests, NeuralNets, Clustering, etc, with the aim to have all model types available eventually
- implement many more data normalisation methods
- implement data engineering of datasets via the application
- and much more...
